# CleanIT

This script is to take care of organising projects with run time modules, build and development or preproduction files or folders. 
As an example, individual develpment environment folder, like __node_modules__ take up disk space.

## AIMS
For basic house keeping, this script removes development folders and their contents to free up space. 

## Consideration

- Indentify active projects
- Cleanup based on non active development
