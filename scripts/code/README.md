# listx

A simple script to list current installed Extensions in **[VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and write to a install script called ```extensions.list```

for the record, I have added my last extention list here ["extensions.list"](./scripts/code/extensions.list).

I like ast some stage to setup optional install parameters like;
- Install ALL
- Install or update MARKED
- Install and or remove arrording to Desired Workspace or operation
- To Setup a Replication and or syncronisation across platforms or workstations.
- To list STATUS, Version and alerts before openting Code. This may help as a morning chore before coffee.  Nothing wors than seeing a lot of Promtps for updates after opening a FILE or Project to work on.

Im open to other suggestions >> CONTRIBUTIONS
